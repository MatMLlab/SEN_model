# Matbench_test_for_SEN_model
This is a repository for NMI reviewers.
Detailed description of the SEN is prepared in `Cap_Models` file.

## Description
This is a deep learning model for structure symmetry description, material property prediction, and material design, which is based on the symmetry-enhanced capsule transformer.


## About the matbench test
- All testing results can be found in `test_raw_file`..
- The feature extraction block is defined in `cap_block.py`.
- The symmetry perception block is defined in `models/che_env_block.py`.
